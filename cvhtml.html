        <h5>PROFILE</h5>
        <p>I’m a sophomore at Michigan State University studying Physiology with a 3.941 GPA. I’m a Michigan Emergency Medical Technician and served as a
          combat medic in Ukraine. I also consistently volunteered at the local hospital
          and food bank. I have a variety of experiences and skills ranging from
          programming to competition shooting to first-aid, and I also have significant
          interests in volunteering and hobbies like game design.</p>
        <h5>EXPERIENCE</h5>
        <p><li>EMT Program, Lansing Community College—2022, Jan-June
          I participated in the Emergency Medical Technician training program at
          Lansing Community College, earning my EMT-B license in a 18 weeks long
          course while simultaneously taking 16 credits at Michigan State University.
          It's certainly a challenging journey, but I am happy for the opportunity to
          serve my local community by being an EMT</li></p>
          <p><li>MSU Shooting Team, 2022 August
            I am a part of the Michigan State University Shooting Team, I practiced and
            competed in Air Pistol and Sports Pistol shooting. Even though shooting is
            not a varsity program, I traveled and competed against shooters from
            different schools such as Central Michigan and Ohio State.</li></p>
            <p><li>Medic at 128th Mountain Assault Brigade, Armed Forces of Ukraine*, 2023
              May-June
              I volunteered to serve as a medic with my medical background for the 15th
              Mountain Infantry Battalion of the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade of the
              Ukrainian Army at Ternopil in May 2023, before getting discharged due to
              citizenship issues. During my brief time with the 128th's in Uzhhorod, I helped
              numerous soldiers with basic life saving medical training. Being a qualified
              EMT myself, I was able to utilize my medical knowledge to potentially make a
              difference and save lives.</li></p>
              <p><li>Volunteer at Greater Lansing Food Bank — 2022 August
                I volunteer almost weekly to sort out the donated food items in the food
                bank's warehouse. The main sources of donations are from companies and
                local farmers, and it is my job to unload and sort the food items into more
                manageable portions. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, knowing that my
                actions are helping those in need in my local community.</li></p> 
                <p><li>Volunteer at Sparrow Hospital Lansing — 2022 August
I volunteered at the Medical/Surgical Pavilion at the Neumann wing. I'm in
charge of non-medical care for patients, such as providing food and drinks,
talking with patients and keeping them company. It's one of the most
fulfilling experiences I've had, as I'm able to form a real connection with the
patients while providing them with care.</li></p>
<p><li>Founder, Lead Game Designer, Incognito Studios, 2019-2022
  I expressed my love for art and design by founding a game studio by myself
  and developed 2 standalone games and 16 unique and individual projects,
  from first person shooter games to simple platformers. Every project is
  developed, designed and programmed by myself. Here is a link to my
  portfolio, https://www.youtube.com/@IncognitoStudios/videos.</li></p> 
  <p><li>Intern Programmer at Microsoft Shanghai Branch—2021 August-
